% Very basic LaTeX template for interating with MultiMarkdown. This should read as the top part of the document.

%metadata.tex is a file for injecting raw LaTeX metadata, which is sometimes required for academic papers.
%As an example, authors sometimes require \thanks or \And which cannot be expressed from MMD metadata fields.
%If the file doesn't exist, it isn't loaded.
\IfFileExists{./metadata.tex}{\input{./metadata.tex}}{}

\documentclass[12pt]{report}

\usepackage{hyperref}
\usepackage{booktabs}

\mytitle
\myauthor

\maketitle

% If an abstract has been defined, include it in the document. Otherwise, safely exclude the abstract.
\ifx\myabstract\undefined
